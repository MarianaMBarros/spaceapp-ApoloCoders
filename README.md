The challenge - Purify the Air Supply
Has internal time increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of stay-at-home policies around the world? Your challenge is to use the International Space Station (ISS) as an inspiration and develop a system to monitor and / or purify indoor air. It is up to you to decide whether the system you design can be used on Earth (for example, in homes, businesses, transportation, etc.) and / or in space.

Many people are unaware that there are not only standards for indoor air quality, but also indoor air quality standards to benefit human health in our homes and other indoor spaces.

NASA astronauts are very familiar with the importance of indoor air quality in the confinement of spacecraft. The composition of the air at the International Space Station (ISS) is taken very seriously, as it can literally make the difference between life and death. NASA developed air filtration techniques to remove harmful particles from the air (to protect equipment from lunar dust, for example) and maintain a favorable mixture of gases to ensure the well-being of the crew.

 ** 2 . Project summary

Our challenge calls for a solution for the purification or monitoring of indoor air in closed environments, which can be used both for the community and for space travel. The proposed solution was to enhance the air filtration already performed by the LSS system (Life Supporting System) of the spacecraft through pigmented ink based on biocidal copper in the air pipes in order to eliminate microorganisms and embed sensors in the filter to detect changes in the air (humidity, CO2 index, and CO) and foreign organisms, thus avoiding contagion and infections in space travel and artificially ventilated terrestrial environments.

** 4 . App

The app was developed in the javascripts programming language and using the React Native framework.
Prototype: 


to access the app: 
   * To access the project do a fork or a clone.
   * Install the dependencies with the command in the `npm install` terminal.
   * To check your application, do a `npm start` in the terminal and it will show the url to access your web server` http: // localhost: 5000`.
